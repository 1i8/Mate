Your Cross-Platform Growtopia Companion

## About The Project

There are many Growtopia companion tools available, but almost all of them are Windows-only, and I'm here to change that. Instead of being a GUI-focused app, I want to do something creative. This will be compiled as a CLI program, and it will open a port that you can use to preview the bots in your favorite browser, including their location in the world, manipulating location, and more. This is programmed in Rust, ensuring high performance and safety.

Star this project if you're interested in its journey!
